Very much a work in progress....
Using Data of 2022 World Internet Speed to create a simple but hopefully somewhat entertaining game. 



Prototype Link: https://jjjcho92.github.io/Connections_Lab/Wk3_Assignment/




What's in this draft: 

1. Call in the data, showing a pair randomly (in real game the speed won't be shown when playing ofc)
2. Basic layout



Issues:

1. Not sure how to fetch a second JSON file. Thinking of using Flag Emojis instead of Text for Country Names
2. Really lost w/ CSS.....watched Beth's workshop, played the Flex Frog...read the cheat sheet, still very lost when trying to execute irl
3. Still have to figure out all the interactive functions
