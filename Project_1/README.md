## Key concept(s) and/or intention(s) driving the project:
- Internet quality and price in the United States is always shocking to me, and my current internet connection is not only slow, unstable, and pricy. The sad part is I can't even find another option as it's a co-op old building in NYC, and Spectrum is the only provider. 
- Friends from South Korea visited and stayed at my place for a week, complained about my internet speed every single day. While I was a little annoyed, it did got me wonder how much faster the average household internet speed and price is in other countries. 
- In Hasan Minhaj's Netflix show "Patriot Act", a 2019 epsoide "Why Your Internet Sucks" investigated into the internet issue in the United States. The finding was really interesting and...sad:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw87-zP2VNA 
- With these in mind, I found the Internet Speed Ranking data for 2022, and thoguht to do a simple guessing game, as I was curious about other people's assumption. 


## Production decisions (i.e. technical, design, creative, etc.)
- Was planning to make the layout as simple as possible, a guessing game that people can choose from 2 options. The colors are intended to be more playful or toy-like. 
- Was deciding between an information display site or a game, but I thought involving guessing would be more fun.
- Was debating if I should just included "more common" countries in the game, but decided to be equal and includes all the countries that made it onto the list, even if this means there might be a lot of countries people don't know where they are geographically. 
- Decided to use national flags, but it might accidentally turned into a flag guessing game instead. 


## Major challenges and solutions
- A lot of limitation due to CSS illiteracy...not able to make the display exactly as I had in mind. 
- Tried to do RWD but my head hurts. 
- Aside from CSS, JS is no doubt another long way of learning hell. I'm not very good with programming / logical thinking, and I have not done any math since high school. I know many people argued being good at math has nothing do with programming...but I beg to differ :) 
- Figuring out some basic logic, functions was rewarding, but it was definetely a lot of headache. I think I just have to read more, do more, in order to get better. 
- After connecting the two JSON files, turned out a lot of country names are different in the two data sets. Thus, a lot of countries were shown as "undefined" instead of the flags. I made correction manually to match the names in the JSON files. 
- I also read other classmate's code to learn from, which has been really helpful. 


## Lessons learned as well as potential next steps if work on the project continues
- Try to ask for help, even when thinking the question is too lame to ask
- Always start with wireframing, even after pivoting, and changing ideas. 
- Need to utilize Office Hours with TAs 
- I want to start to learn CSS from the beginning all over again, as I feel like my foundation is very weak, and gets confused easily during the process of constructing the design. 
- I might still want to finish the basic game function (clicking, showing answers, and keeping scores...etc), but honestly my interest level is getting low. However, I do want to fix some CSS basic problems on this one, really using it to try to understand what's going on.
